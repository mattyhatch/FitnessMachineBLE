# FitnessMachineBLE

How to use:      
When you first open the app, make sure to press the location button so then the app can access your devices location.
This is important because location is needed for a BLE connection.
Now the app is ready to use. You can set the advertising name in the first activity by editing the text on the screen.
Next, choose which fitness machine you want to broadcast as by clicking on their respective buttons.
Once you are in one of the activities(either indoor bike,treadmill, or cross trainer), you can start to advertise your android device over BLE by pressing the
advertise button. Once a connection is established, you can disconnect by reclicking that same button, which should now say stop advertising.
After you have established a connection, you can now send data over by changing the values on the screen to what you want them to be and press notify.
After pressing the notify button, the data should be available on the client that you are connected to.
